**Make it simple to work with locations and data about the world**

It should be easy to do things like get a list of US States, Canadian
Provinces, and to determine if a postal code or phone number is valid.
Some countries don't use postal codes at all, phone numbers have different
criteria across countries. This library aims to make things a little easier.
